python3 main.py --text "NOP slides, also known as "no-operation" slides, are often used in presentations to pause the progression of slides without interrupting the presentation flow. However, while they may seem harmless, NOP slides can actually be dangerous in certain contexts. For example, if used during an emergency or security briefing, NOP slides can create confusion and cause critical information to be missed. Similarly, if a presenter relies too heavily on NOP slides to fill time or avoid answering difficult questions, they can come across as unprepared or untrustworthy. Therefore, while NOP slides can be a useful tool for presentations, they should be used sparingly and thoughtfully to avoid potentially serious consequences." --key "YOUR_API_KEY"
